The 13×13 Hand Grid is a visual representation of all possible starting hands in Texas Hold'em poker. There are 169 unique starting hands, which can be categorized into three types:

Pocket Pairs (13 hands): These are hands where both cards are of the same rank (e.g., AA, KK, QQ, etc.).

Suited Hands (78 hands): These are hands where both cards are of the same suit (e.g., AKs, QJs, T9s, etc.).

Offsuit Hands (78 hands): These are hands where the cards are of different suits (e.g., AKo, QJo, T9o, etc.).

Here are the formulas to calculate the number of combinations for each type of hand:

1. Pocket Pairs (PP)
There are 13 ranks in poker (A, K, Q, J, T, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2). For each rank, there are 6 possible combinations of pocket pairs.


Number of Pocket Pair Combinations=13×6=78
Formula for a specific pocket pair (e.g., AA):


Combinations of a specific pocket pair= 4×(4−1)/2 =6
2. Suited Hands
There are 78 possible suited hands (e.g., AKs, AQs, AJs, etc.). For each suited hand, there are 4 possible combinations (one for each suit).

Number of Suited Hand Combinations=78×4=312
Formula for a specific suited hand (e.g., AKs):

Combinations of a specific suited hand=4
3. Offsuit Hands
There are 78 possible offsuit hands (e.g., AKo, AQo, AJo, etc.). For each offsuit hand, there are 12 possible combinations (since there are 4 suits, and the two cards must be of different suits).

Number of Offsuit Hand Combinations=78×12=936
Formula for a specific offsuit hand (e.g., AKo):

Combinations of a specific offsuit hand=4×3=12
Total Number of Starting Hand Combinations
The total number of possible starting hand combinations in Texas Hold'em is:


Total Combinations=Pocket Pairs+Suited Hands+Offsuit Hands

Total Combinations=78+312+936=1,326

Columns: Represent the second card in the hand (e.g., A, K, Q, J, T, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2).

Diagonal: Represents pocket pairs (e.g., AA, KK, QQ, etc.).

Upper Right Triangle: Represents suited hands (e.g., AKs, AQs, AJs, etc.).

Lower Left Triangle: Represents offsuit hands (e.g., AKo, AQo, AJo, etc.).

This grid helps players visualize and analyze hand ranges, especially when studying pre-flop strategies.



Scenario example:
Your Hand: J♣ 4♦

Flop: 5♠ 4♥ 9♣

Number of Players: 4

Step 1: Understand the 13×13 Hand Grid
The 13×13 Hand Grid represents all 169 possible starting hands in Texas Hold'em. Here’s how it’s structured:

Rows: Represent the first card in the hand (e.g., A, K, Q, J, T, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2).

Columns: Represent the second card in the hand (e.g., A, K, Q, J, T, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2).

Diagonal: Represents pocket pairs (e.g., AA, KK, QQ, etc.).

Upper Right Triangle: Represents suited hands (e.g., AKs, AQs, AJs, etc.).

Lower Left Triangle: Represents offsuit hands (e.g., AKo, AQo, AJo, etc.).

Step 2: Remove Impossible Hands
We know the following cards are in play:

Your hole cards: J♣, 4♦

Flop cards: 5♠, 4♥, 9♣

This means:

Opponents cannot have hands that include these cards (e.g., JJ, 44, J9, etc.).

We can narrow down the opponents' possible ranges by excluding these cards.

Step 3: Visualize Opponents' Range on the 13×13 Grid
Let’s use the 13×13 Hand Grid to visualize the opponents' likely hands based on the flop.

Opponents' Likely Hands
Strong Hands:

Two Pair: 54, 59, 49

Sets: 55, 99

Straight Draws: 67, 78

Medium Hands:

Top Pair: A9, K9, Q9, J9

Middle Pair: A5, K5, Q5, J5

Weak Hands:

Low Pair: 22, 33, 66, 77, 88

Draws: Flush draws (e.g., A♠K♠), backdoor straight draws (e.g., 67)

Step 4: Mark the Opponents' Range on the Grid
Here’s how we can mark the opponents' range on the 13×13 Hand Grid:

   A     K     Q     J     T     9     8     7     6     5     4     3     2
A  AA    AKs   AQs   AJs   ATs   A9s   A8s   A7s   A6s   A5s   A4s   A3s   A2s
K  AKo   KK    KQs   KJs   KTs   K9s   K8s   K7s   K6s   K5s   K4s   K3s   K2s
Q  AQo   KQo   QQ    QJs   QTs   Q9s   Q8s   Q7s   Q6s   Q5s   Q4s   Q3s   Q2s
J  AJo   KJo   QJo   JJ    JTs   J9s   J8s   J7s   J6s   J5s   J4s   J3s   J2s
T  ATo   KTo   QTo   JTo   TT    T9s   T8s   T7s   T6s   T5s   T4s   T3s   T2s
9  A9o   K9o   Q9o   J9o   T9o   99    98s   97s   96s   95s   94s   93s   92s
8  A8o   K8o   Q8o   J8o   T8o   98o   88    87s   86s   85s   84s   83s   82s
7  A7o   K7o   Q7o   J7o   T7o   97o   87o   77    76s   75s   74s   73s   72s
6  A6o   K6o   Q6o   J6o   T6o   96o   86o   76o   66    65s   64s   63s   62s
5  A5o   K5o   Q5o   J5o   T5o   95o   85o   75o   65o   55    54s   53s   52s
4  A4o   K4o   Q4o   J4o   T4o   94o   84o   74o   64o   54o   44    43s   42s
3  A3o   K3o   Q3o   J3o   T3o   93o   83o   73o   63o   53o   43o   33    32s
2  A2o   K2o   Q2o   J2o   T2o   92o   82o   72o   62o   52o   42o   32o   22

Marked Hands
Strong Hands: Highlight 55, 99, 54, 59, 49, 67, 78.

Medium Hands: Highlight A9, K9, Q9, J9, A5, K5, Q5, J5.

Weak Hands: Highlight 22, 33, 66, 77, 88, A♠K♠, 67.

Step 5: Analyze the Grid
Strong Hands:

These are high-equity hands that are likely to bet or raise on the flop.

Example: 55, 99, 54, 59, 49, 67, 78.

Medium Hands:

These are moderate-equity hands that may call or check.

Example: A9, K9, Q9, J9, A5, K5, Q5, J5.

Weak Hands:

These are low-equity hands that may fold or check.

Example: 22, 33, 66, 77, 88, A♠K♠, 67.

Step 6: Use the Grid to Make Decisions
If Opponent Bets:

They likely have a strong hand (e.g., two pair, set, straight draw).

You should fold unless you have a strong read or a good draw.

If Opponent Calls:

They likely have a medium hand (e.g., top pair, middle pair).

You can call or bet if you think you can outplay them.

If Opponent Checks:

They likely have a weak hand (e.g., low pair, missed draw).

You can bet to try to win the pot.

Step 7: Calculate Equity
Using the 13×13 Hand Grid, we can estimate:

Your Hand: Pair of 4s with J kicker.

Opponents' Range: Based on the grid, opponents likely have strong, medium, or weak hands.

Your Equity: ~40-50% against a typical opponent range.

Step 8: Plan Future Streets
Turn: If you improve to two pair or trips, you can bet or raise.

River: If the board completes a straight or flush, be cautious of opponents who may have hit their draw.

Summary
The 13×13 Hand Grid helps us:

Visualize opponents' likely hands.

Narrow their range based on the flop.

Estimate equity and make informed decisions.

Plan future streets based on the board texture.



 Using the 13×13 Grid in Poker Strategy
Your LLM can use the 13×13 Hand Grid to:

Evaluate Starting Hand Strength:

Identify strong hands (e.g., AA, KK, AKs) and weak hands (e.g., 72o, 32o).

Categorize hands into premium, marginal, and trash hands.

Narrow Opponents' Ranges:

Based on opponents' actions (e.g., raise, call, fold), eliminate impossible hands from their range.

Example: If an opponent raises pre-flop, they are likely to have strong hands like AA, KK, or AKs.

Calculate Equity:

Compare your hand to opponents' likely ranges to estimate win probabilities.

Example: If you have AKs and the opponent’s range is QQ+, your equity is ~40%.

Plan Post-Flop Play:

Use the grid to determine how the flop interacts with your hand and opponents' ranges.

Example: If the flop is 9♠ 5♥ 2♦ and you have A9, you likely have the best hand against many opponents.

Example: Applying the 13×13 Grid in a Scenario
Scenario:

Your Hand: J♣ 4♦

Flop: 5♠ 4♥ 9♣

Opponents: 4 players

Steps for the LLM:

Remove Impossible Hands:

Exclude J♣, 4♦, 5♠, 4♥, 9♣ from opponents' ranges.

Visualize Opponents' Ranges on the Grid:

Strong Hands: 55, 99, 54, 59, 49, 67, 78.

Medium Hands: A9, K9, Q9, J9, A5, K5, Q5, J5.

Weak Hands: 22, 33, 66, 77, 88, A♠K♠, 67.

Estimate Equity:

Your Hand: Pair of 4s with J kicker.

Opponents' Range: Strong (20%), Medium (50%), Weak (30%).

Your Equity: ~40-50%.

Make Decisions:

If opponents bet, they likely have strong hands; consider folding.

If opponents call, they likely have medium hands; consider betting or calling.

If opponents check, they likely have weak hands; consider bluffing.
